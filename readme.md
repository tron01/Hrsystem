# HR System Microservices Project

## Overview

This is a Microservices-based HR System built using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud**, **Eureka**, **Spring Cloud Gateway**, **Kafka**, and **Docker Compose**. The system includes services for:

- User Authentication
- Job Posting
- Resume Parsing
- Application Submission
- Monitoring with Spring Boot Admin
- Asynchronous Resume Parsing triggered by Job Applications

---

## Docker Compose

Kafka and Zookeeper are used for asynchronous communication and are managed via `docker-compose.yml`:

```
docker-compose up
```

This command brings up:

- **Kafka**
- **Zookeeper**

---

## Security

- JWT-based authentication via `auth-service`
- HTTP-only cookie-based token handling through API Gateway

---

## Monitoring

- **Spring Boot Admin** monitors all microservices
- Integrated with **Spring Boot Actuator** for health and metrics

---

## Service Discovery

- All services register with **Eureka Server** at `http://localhost:8761`
- API Gateway uses Eureka for dynamic routing

---

| `/applications`       | `application-submit-service` | `/api/applications/**`       |
| `/auth`               | `auth-service`               | `/api/auth/**`               |
| `/admin/users`        | `auth-service`               | `/api/admin/users/**`        |

## Communication

- **Kafka** is used for event-driven scenarios:
   - When a user submits a job application, an event is published to Kafka
   - The **Resume Parser Service** listens for this event and automatically processes the uploaded resume

---

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven
- Docker
- IntelliJ IDEA or similar IDE

### Steps

1. Start Kafka and Zookeeper:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
2. Start Eureka Server
3. Start Spring Boot Admin
4. Start API Gateway
5. Start remaining services (Auth, Job, Resume, Application)

### Access URLs

- Eureka Dashboard: `http://localhost:8761`
- Spring Boot Admin: `http://localhost:9090`
- API Gateway: `http://localhost:8080`

## Configuration Tips

Eureka client config for each service:

```yaml
eureka:
   client:
      service-url:
         defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

Spring Boot Admin client config:

```yaml
spring:
   boot:
      admin:
         client:
            url: http://localhost:9090
            instance:
               prefer-ip: true
```

## Future Enhancements

- Deploy to Kubernetes
- Build front-end using React or Thymeleaf
- Integrate OAuth2 or Keycloak for authentication
